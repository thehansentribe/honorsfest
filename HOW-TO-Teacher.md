# How to Use the System - Teacher Guide

## Overview
As a **Teacher**, you can view the classes you're assigned to teach and mark attendance and completion for students in those classes. Your dashboard shows all classes you're teaching for events where your club participates.

## Getting Started

### Logging In
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter your username and password
3. Click "Login"
4. You'll be redirected to the Teacher Dashboard

### Dashboard Overview
The Teacher Dashboard shows:
- **My Classes** - List of classes you're assigned to teach
- **Class Roster** - Detailed view of students in a selected class with attendance tracking

## Using the Dashboard

### Viewing Your Classes

1. **Class Selector**: 
   - A dropdown shows all classes you're assigned to teach
   - Classes are shown as: "Honor Name - Date Time"
   - Select a class to view its roster

2. **Class Information**:
   - Each class shows the honor name and timeslot
   - Classes are organized by the event they belong to
   - You only see classes for events where your club participates

### Viewing and Managing Class Rosters

#### Selecting a Class
1. Use the **"Select Class"** dropdown to choose a class
2. The roster card appears below showing all enrolled students

#### Roster Information
For each student, you can see:
- **Student Name**: First and last name
- **Club**: Which club the student belongs to
- **Investiture Level**: Student's current investiture level (Friend, Companion, Explorer, etc.)

#### Marking Attendance

1. **Attended Checkbox**:
   - Check this box when a student attends the class
   - Uncheck if they don't attend
   - Changes save automatically when you click the checkbox

2. **Completed Checkbox**:
   - Check this box when a student completes the class requirements
   - Uncheck if they haven't completed it yet
   - Changes save automatically when you click the checkbox

**Important Notes**:
- Attendance can be marked before or during the event
- Completion is typically marked after the class session
- Checkboxes are locked when the event status is "Closed"
- Changes are saved immediately - no "Save" button needed

### Event Status Banner

- **Green Banner**: Event is active and registration may be open
- **Yellow Banner**: Registration is closed - you can still view rosters but registrations cannot be modified
- **No Banner**: Everything is normal

When the event is closed, attendance checkboxes are locked and cannot be changed. This preserves attendance records after the event ends.

## Profile Management

### Editing Your Own Profile
1. Click on your name in the top banner (it's underlined and clickable)
2. You can update:
   - First Name and Last Name
   - Email (optional for Teachers)
   - Phone
   - Investiture Level
   - Password (local users only)
3. Click **"Update Profile"**

**Note**: 
- For Stytch users, password changes must be done through Stytch's password reset feature
- Changing email for Stytch users sends a verification email
- You cannot change your club assignment or role

## Best Practices

1. **Before the Event**:
   - Review your assigned classes
   - Familiarize yourself with student names and clubs
   - Note the timeslots for your classes

2. **During the Event**:
   - Mark attendance as students arrive
   - Check the correct checkboxes for each student
   - Update completion status after class sessions

3. **After the Event**:
   - Verify all attendance is marked correctly
   - Mark completion for students who finished requirements
   - Attendance is locked when the event closes, so complete marking before then

4. **Accuracy**:
   - Double-check student names before marking attendance
   - Verify completion status is accurate
   - Contact Club Director if you notice students not on your roster who should be there

## Troubleshooting

**No classes showing:**
- You may not be assigned to any classes yet
- Contact your Club Director or an Event Admin
- Verify your club is participating in events

**Can't mark attendance:**
- Check if the event status is "Closed" (checkboxes are locked)
- Contact an Event Admin if you need to make changes after event closure
- Verify you're selecting the correct class

**Student missing from roster:**
- Student may not have registered for your class
- Student may have dropped the class
- Contact your Club Director to verify student registration

**Check-in number not showing:**
- Check-in numbers are assigned by Admins
- Not all users have check-in numbers
- This doesn't affect attendance marking
