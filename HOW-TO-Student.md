### Multiple Events
If your club participates in multiple events:
- Use the **Event Selector** dropdown in the top banner
- Select an event to see classes for that event

### Filtering Classes
1. **By Timeslot**: Select a specific timeslot to see only classes during that time
2. **By Teacher**: Select a teacher to see only classes taught by that teacher

   - Be aware of timeslot conflicts
   - Don't register for too many classes at once

3. **Managing Your Classes**:
   - Review your schedule regularly
   - Drop classes you can't attend (frees spots for others)
   - Check waitlist positions
   - Verify times and locations before the event

4. **Communication**:
   - Contact your Club Director with questions
   - Ask about registration codes if you need one
   - Report any issues with class registration

5. **Multiple Events**:
   - Switch between events using the event selector
   - Remember that registrations are event-specific
   - Plan your schedule for each event separately

## Troubleshooting
