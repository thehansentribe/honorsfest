## ⚠️ Known Issue

### better-sqlite3 Installation
The `better-sqlite3` package requires native compilation and may fail on Node.js version 22+. 

**Solutions:**
1. Install with build tools (see SETUP.md)
2. Downgrade to Node.js 18 or 20
3. Use alternative database package
4. Use prebuilt binary: `npm install better-sqlite3@7.6.3`

## 🚀 To Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Seed database (loads honors and creates admin user)
npm run seed

# Start server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Login: admin / password123
```

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Mobile-first**: Responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px
- **User-friendly**: Toast notifications, validation messages
- **Accessible**: Clean forms, proper labels
- **Consistent**: CSS variables for theming

## 📝 Next Steps for Full Implementation

The following dashboard files need additional JavaScript for complete functionality:
- `admin-dashboard.js` - Full CRUD for events/users/locations/clubs/classes
- `eventadmin-dashboard.js` - Event-filtered management
- `clubdirector-dashboard.js` - Bulk user add grid, CSV generation

The core infrastructure is complete and functional. The student and teacher dashboards are fully implemented as proof of concept.

- ✅ Timeslot conflict prevention
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Pre-populated honors database (527 entries)
- ✅ Responsive mobile-first design
- ✅ CSV reporting
